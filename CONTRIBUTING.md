# Development


The goal of this project is to build a non commercial open source platform to help people organize and host in person events. The backend will also have an open API that other specialized websites can use to list and manage events.


As a starting point, the project has a site specific for board games in the Washington, DC area, https://dmvboardgames.com/.

# Development guidelines

## Development proccess
- Post a comment on an issue indicating that you want to start working on it.
- Once the issue is assigned to you, and you are finished with a code change for the issue, create a PR to the main branch. If a feature is complex, split up the work into mupltiple smaller PRs if possible.
- Once a PR has passed the review, a maintainer will approve and merge it.

## Development guidelines
- Keep the changes limited to the scope of the issue. If you think it makes sense to update the scope, post a comment on the issue.
- All code for a feature must be written by a developer. Code written by ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude Sonnet, or any other generative AI tool cannot be used.
- If you want to introduce a new technology not listed as part of the tech stack, email gulu@createthirdplaces.com. Include details about the technology and why you think it would be useful. If it is determined that the technology is relevant, you will get a reply back indicating that it can be used.
- All communication with the backend will be done through API endpoints implemented in the backend repo.

# Suggesting changes
If you have a recommendation for a new feature, enhancment, or bug fix, create an issue in the development repo. Make sure any issues created follow these guidelines.
- Working on the issue does not require using generative AI or machine learning tools.
- All changes must support the goal of encouraging people to interact in person. For example, a feature for playing games on the Internet will not be added. On the other hand, a feature that makes it easier for people to find in person social events would be a good fit for the website.
